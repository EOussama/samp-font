# Description
Samp Front is a basic starter landing page template for [SA:MP](https://www.sa-mp.com/) communities related websites. It's always better to craft your stuff from scratch, however, for the oblivious, it's life saving to have a starter prototype filling your hands at your debut.
Of course, Samp Front can be customized to meet your needs, that's the reason for affixing it with the word “template”. However, note that the credits should remain untouched so that the contributors are at least acknowledged.
